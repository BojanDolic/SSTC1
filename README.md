# Story

Ever since I visited the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade in high school, and saw the tesla coil in person, I wanted to build my own version for myself. After all, it is pretty hard to make one and it is also a dangerous device.

I've always tinkered with electronics but never had a chance to build one until now. Although this one and the one in Belgrade differ quite a bit (besides the size :D), the principle of the operation is the same.

Unlike the one in the museum, this one uses semiconductors instead of the spark gap.
